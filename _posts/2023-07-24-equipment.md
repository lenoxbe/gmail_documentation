# Description of Equipment/Materials

This section describes the equipment and materials needed to use Gmail.

## Computer/Laptop/Mobile Device

Gmail can be accessed from any device (1) with an internet connection and (2) that can run a web browser or gmail application, including desktop computers, laptops, and smartphones, and tablets. Each of these devices may provide a slightly different user experience, depending especially on whether you are using a mobile device. These devices do, however, all give you access to all or nearly all of Gmail's features.

## Internet Connection

Gmail requires an internet connection. A user can read, respond to, and search their Gmail messages even when they aren't connected to the internet by installing the Gmail Offline app from the Google Chrome Browser.

## Web Browser/Gmail App

Gmail can be accessed using any web browser, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Alternatively, Gmail can be accessed via the Gmail app on devices running an Android, iOS, or Google operating system. 
The most common laptop and desktop operating systems come with a web browser pre-installed.  Each of the following are appropriate for accessing Gmail:
