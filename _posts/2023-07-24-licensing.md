# Licensing

Gmail is a free-to-use service.  An individual who signs up for a Gmail account does not need a license to create this account or use this service.

Some Google services (such as Google Workspace) purchased by businesses and other institutions for use in their capacity as a business do require that users are licensed.

Licenses can be site-based, meaning that each user in the organization is automatically licensed to use Gmail, or user-based, meaning that each user in the organization needs a license to use Gmail.

More information about license agreements can be found [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6309862?hl=en&ref_topic=2769071&sjid=368256426981687083-NA).
