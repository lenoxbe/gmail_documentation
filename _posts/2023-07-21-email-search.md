# Using the Search Feature

The search bar is useful for finding emails, especially in a cluttered inbox.

Gmail allows for the following search options:

1. To search for mail that contains exact wording in the body text
	- Type in those words enclosed by quotation marks
2. To search for mail that contains words in the subject line
	- Type `subject:words to include`
3. To search for mail from a specified email address
	- Type `from:username@domain.com`
4. To search for mail sent to a specified recipient
	- Type `to:username@domain.com`
5. To search for mail with a certain label (including the "starred" or "important" psuedo-labels as well as category labels)
	- Type `label:labelName`
6. To search for mail sent before or after a specific date
	- Type `after:MM/DD/YYYY` or `before:MM/DD/YYYY`
7. To search for mail sent before or after a certain time period
	- Type `newer_than:timeCode` or `older_than:timeCode`
	- Time codes are encoded time periods, using `d` to represent days, `m` for months, and `y` for years.
	- For example, 5 months would be represented as `5m`, while 75 days would be represented as `75d`.
8. To search for mail with attachments
	- Type `has:attachments`
9. To combine search terms
	- Type `searchTermOne AND searchTermTwo` to find mail matching both search terms
	- Type `searchTermOne OR searchTermTwo` to find mail matching either search term
