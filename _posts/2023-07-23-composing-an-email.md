2. The new message window has three sections, from top to bottom, these are:
	1. The Recipients Section
	2. The Subject Section
	3. The Message Body Section
3. Click the recipients section.  Enter the email address(es) of the intended message recipients.  Press enter after entering each email address to send the email to multiple email addresses.
	
	The recipients section has two other options, Cc (Carbon Copy) and Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy).  These buttons appear on the right side of the recipients section when the recipients section is selected.  Clicking on either one will create a new line for Cc or Bcc email addresses, depending on the button the user clicked.
	- Cc'ing an email address in an email will send a copy of that email to the email address Cc'ed.  This Cc'ed email address will be visible to the primary recipient(s) of the email.
	- Bcc'ing an email address in an email will send a copy of that email to the email address Bcc'ed.  This Bcc'ed email address will *not* be visible to the primary recipient(s) of the email.
4. Click the subject section.  Type the subject of the email.
5. Click on the message body section.  Type the message body.
