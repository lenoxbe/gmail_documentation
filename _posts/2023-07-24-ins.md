# Instructions for Use

This section will guide you through the basic features of Gmail.

## Creating an Account

1. Go to the [Gmail homepage](https://mail.google.com).
2. Click on "Create account".
3. Fill out the form with your first and last name, desired email address, password, and phone number.
4. Click "Next" and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup of your new Gmail account.

## Signing Into Gmail

2. Enter your Gmail email address and click "Next".
3. Enter your password and click "Next" again to sign in.

## Understanding the Gmail Interface

The Gmail interface consists of three main parts: the sidebar, the inbox, and the reading pane. The sidebar contains links to different sections of Gmail (like Inbox, Starred, Sent, etc.), as well as any labels you've created. The inbox shows a list of your emails, and the reading pane displays the content of the currently selected email.

## Composing and Sending Email

1. Click the "Compose" button in the left sidebar.
2. In the New Message window, enter the recipient's email address, the subject of the email, and your message.
3. When you're ready, click "Send".

## Reading and Replying to Email

1. Click on an email in your inbox to open it in the reading pane.
2. To reply, click the "Reply" button below the email.
3. Write your response and click "Send".

## Organizing Emails

You can organize your emails by using labels, stars, and filters. Labels are like folders, but an email can have multiple labels. Stars are a way to highlight important emails. Filters can automatically label, archive, delete, star, or forward your emails based on specific criteria.

## Using the Search Feature

You can use the search bar at the top of the Gmail interface to find emails. You can search for words that appear in any part of the email, or use search operators to filter your search.

## Adding Contacts

1. Click on the Google Apps icon (the grid of squares at the top right of the screen) and select "Contacts".
2. Click "Create contact" and enter the person's information.
3. Click "Save".

## Using Other Features

Gmail integrates with other Google services like Google Meet and Google Keep. You can start a new Google Meet video call directly from Gmail, or open Google Keep to take notes without leaving your inbox.
