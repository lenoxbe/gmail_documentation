## Reading an Email

Click on an email in the inbox section. This will open the email's reading pane.  Here, the email's contents can be viewed.

## Replying to an Email

To reply, click the "Reply" button below the body text of the email. This will open a new message window nearly identical to the new message window that appears when the compose button is clicked.  Refer to the section on composing emails for further instruction on composing this reply.

## Forwarding an Email

Forwarding an email can be thought of as sending a copy of an email to someone.  To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open an email and click the Forward button below the message text.  
2. Enter recipients, Cc recipients, and Bcc recipients.  
3. If desired, compose a message over the forwarded email.
4. Click "Send."
