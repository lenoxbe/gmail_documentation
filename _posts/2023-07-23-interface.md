## The Sidebar

The <span class="sidebar-highlight">sidebar</span> contains links to different views of the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span> that will display specific types of emails depending on how the emails are categorized.

These views will display the following types of emails:
- **Inbox:** The main inbox, which will display all emails.
- **Starred:** All emails the user has "starred." Starring emails is usually used to mark emails as important, or needing urgent attention.
- **Snoozed:** All emails the user has labeled as "snoozed." Snoozing emails is usually used on emails that are not time-sensitive and that can be received again at a later date.
- **Sent:** All emails the user has sent.
- **Drafts:** All emails that the user has begun writing, but have not been sent.
- **Labels:** All Labels the user has created will be listed here.  Labels can be used to organize emails.

## The Inbox

The <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span> displays a list of emails and the information associated with each email such as the sender, the subject, a small amount of the message text, and the date and time it was sent.  If the email was sent on the current date, the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span> will just display the time that the email was sent.
Other than displaying emails, the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span> section has the following features listed below.

The <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span> allows the user to: 
- Click emails to display the <span class="reading-pane-highlight">reading pane</span> for that email
- Select emails, or select all emails
- Add different categories/apply different labels to emails as well as star emails, snooze emails, mark emails as read/unread (marking an email as read will make it appear dim in the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span>, while marking an email as unread will make it appear bright in the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span>), and mark emails as important.
- Refresh their <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span>
- Switch between email categories.  These category views will only show emails marked as in the selected category.  Categories are listed directly above the messages in the <span class="inbox-highlight">inbox</span>.
	The default categories are:
	- Primary
	- Promotions
	- Social
