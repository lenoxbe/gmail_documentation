# Organizing Emails

Emails can be organized in many different ways including:
- Labels
- Categories
- Stars
- Marking emails as important
- Snoozing emails
- Filters

## Labels

Labels are used to tag emails with various information.  For example, one might have a work label, bills label, social label, family label, etc.

In order to use labels, they first must be created.  To create a label:
1. Click the plus button on the sidebar next to the "Labels" heading.  
	<span class="aside">This will bring up a window on the center of the webpage.</span>
2. Enter the new label's name.  
	<span class="aside">If desired, the label can be a child label of another label.  This is purely for organizational reasons; the two labels will act as separate labels.</span>
4. Click "Create."

Labels can be used by clicking on an email in the inbox, then clicking the Labels button on the toolbar at the top of the reading pane.  The label(s) that the user wishes to apply to the email can be applied by clicking the checkboxes next to the label names.

To view all emails with a specific label, click on a label on the sidebar on the left-hand side of the web page.

## Categories

Categories are nearly identical to labels, but the user cannot create new categories.  The default categories are:
- Social
- Updates
- Forums
- Promotions

Categories are applied to emails the exact same way labels are.  To do this:
1. Check the box of the email(s) to be labeled
2. Click the labels button on the toolbar at the top of the inbox
3. Check the box of the category in which the email belongs
4. Click "Apply."

To view all emails in a category, click the "More" dropdown menu on the left sidebar.  Then, click the "Categories" dropdown menu.  Lastly, click the category to display.

## Stars

Stars are also very similar to a label.  To star emails, click the star icon just beside the checkbox of the email in the inbox.

To view starred emails, click "Starred" on the left sidebar.

## Marking Emails as Important

To mark an email as important, select the checkbox of the email(s) to be marked as important, click the three dots on the right side of the toolbar at the top of the inbox, then click "Mark as important."

To view emails marked as important, click the "More" dropdown list on the left sidebar, then click "Important."

## Snoozing Emails

When an email is snoozed, it will be removed from the inbox until a later, user decided date and time.

To snooze an email:
1. Check the boxes of the email(s) to be snoozed in the inbox
2. Click the "Snooze" button on the toolbar at the top of the inbox
3. Pick a date and time for the email(s) to reappear in the inbox
4. Click "Save."

Snoozed emails can also be viewed.  To do this, click "Snoozed" in the left sidebar.

## Filters

Filters have many purposes.  They can:
- Make specified emails skip the inbox
- Automatically mark specified emails as read
- Automatically star specified emails
- Automaticaly apply a label to specified emails
- Automatically forward specified emails
- Automatically delete specified emails
- Prevent specified emails from being sent to spam
- Automatically mark specified emails as important
- Prevent specified emails from being automatically marked as important
- Automatically categorize emails

Emails are filtered based on a user-defined search criteria.  This criteria includes information such as:
- Sender
- Recipient
- Subject
- Whether the email contains specific words
- Whether the email does not contain specific words
- Whether the email's size is greater than a limit
- Whether the email has attachments

There are two methods of creating a filter. The first way is to select one or more emails, and the second way is without selecting any email(s).

### Creating Filters By Selecting Emails

1. Check the checkbox of the type of email to filter in the inbox
2. Click the three dots on the right hand side of the toolbar at the top of the inbox
3. Click "Filter messages like these."

4. Enter the filter's search criteria (i.e., what emails will be filtered)
5. Click "Create filter."

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/filter2.png" alt="Filter" style="width: 80%;">
6. Check the box(es) that decide what Gmail will do with emails that match the filter's search criteria
7. Click "Create filter."

### Creating Filters Without Selecting Emails

1. Click the "Show search options" button within the search box.

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/filter4.png" alt="Filter" style="width: 80%;">
2. A new filter window will appear on the web page. There are two new parameters: "date within," which is a range of date option, and an option allowing a choice of which inbox to search.
3. Refer back to steps 4 through 7 in the "Creating Filters By Selecting Emails" section.
