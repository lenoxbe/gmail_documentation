# Instructions for Use

This section will guide you through the basic features of Gmail.

## Organizing Emails

You can organize your emails by using labels, stars, and filters. Labels are like folders, but an email can have multiple labels. Stars are a way to highlight important emails. Filters can automatically label, archive, delete, star, or forward your emails based on specific criteria.

## Using the Search Feature

You can use the search bar at the top of the Gmail interface to find emails. You can search for words that appear in any part of the email, or use search operators to filter your search.

## Adding Contacts

1. Click on the Google Apps icon (the grid of squares at the top right of the screen) and select "Contacts".
2. Click "Create contact" and enter the person's information.
3. Click "Save".

## Using Other Features

Gmail integrates with other Google services like Google Meet and Google Keep. You can start a new Google Meet video call directly from Gmail, or open Google Keep to take notes without leaving your inbox.
